## Workspace Structure

Competitive is organized into five main sections:

## Control Plane

At the top of the Competitive screen, you'll find the **Control Plane** — a set of filters that let you customize your analysis:

- **Time Range** — Last 30/90 days, Current quarter, All time
- **Platform** — TikTok, Instagram, or Both
- **Metric** — Views, Engagement, or Likes
- **Normalization** — Raw or normalized (accounts for follower count)

<Info>
Use normalization when comparing brands of different sizes. It levels the playing field by accounting for follower count.
