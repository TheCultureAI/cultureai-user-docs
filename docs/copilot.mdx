## Tips for Better Results

### Be Specific

Instead of: "Update my stuff"

Try: "Update my Instagram handle to @newhandle"

### Ask Follow-up Questions

Copilot remembers your conversation, so you can ask follow-ups:

> You: "Show me my competitors"
> 
> Copilot: *shows list*
> 
> You: "Add @newbrand to that list"

### Use Natural Language

You don't need special commands. Just ask like you would ask a colleague:

- ✅ "Can you add @competitor to my list?"
- ✅ "I want to track the #wellness hashtag"
- ✅ "Start scraping my competitors please"

## Common Questions

### "Why do I need to confirm changes?"

Copilot asks for confirmation before making changes to your data or starting jobs that use resources. This prevents accidental modifications.

### "How long do scraping jobs take?"

Most jobs complete in 2-5 minutes. Large competitor sets or industry scrapes may take longer.

### "Can I cancel a running job?"

Yes! Ask Copilot "Cancel my running job" or click the Cancel button on the Job Status card.

### "How often should I run scrapes?"

We recommend:
- **Brand refresh**: Weekly
- **Competitor scrape**: Weekly or bi-weekly
- **Industry scrape**: Weekly
